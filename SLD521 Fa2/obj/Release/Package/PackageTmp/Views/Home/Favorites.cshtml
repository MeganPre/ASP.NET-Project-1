                    The original X-Men story 'Days of Future Past(opens in new tab) ' was simply two issues of the main ongoing series, 
                    Uncanny X-Men #141 and #142 (Take that, 200+ issue events of today!) In a dystopian future, 
                    mutants have been rounded up into concentration camps; that is, the ones who haven't been slaughtered.

                    In 2006, Marvel Comics decided they were going to ignite the cosmic corner of the Marvel Universe. 
                    Writer Keith Giffen was tapped to conceive a limited series and a set of tie-ins titled Annihilation(opens in new tab), 
                    intended to establish characters new and old as major players in the Marvel universe.

                    Long before anyone could even conceive of carving out a whole corner of the Marvel Universe devoted to cosmic threats, 
                    Jack Kirby and Stan Lee created what may still be considered the ultimate cosmic threat: Galactus.
